The data set contains the annual salary in excess of \$100,000 and the
taxable benefit of the academic staff at the University of Waterloo in
2022. We have removed the surname and the given name of all the members
when importing the data into R since these are not relevant to this
assignment. This data set can be treated as a sample to estimate the
distribution of annual salaries of university professors in 2022 in
Ontario, Canada. The professors here refer to those with position titles
"assistant professor", "associate professor", and "professor".
"Lecturer" is not included in the analysis.
